Line            Meaning
4 1 2           2J pi 2T for initial state
2               Number of states with same quantum numbers
0 1 2           2J pi 2T for one possible final state
2               What kind of transition (multipolarity)
1               How many ways to transition (must preceed this many data lines)
1 1 1.2387      For each way, transition parameters
0 1 2           2J pi 2T for another possible state (maybe same as before)
2               Kind of transition (must be different than before)
