Welcome to ``npsm``!

# What Is npsm?

We have a whole bunch of different codes to run when doing No Core Shell Model
calculations, and a bunch of those tasks are easy to do with Python / Bash.

This code attemps to take the pain out of running NCSM code.

# Getting Started

First clone the [github repository](https://github.com/callum-mccracken/npsm.git)

Make sure you have some kind of way to download python packages, e.g. pip, Anaconda.
We won't need much, but we will need numpy, matplotlib, ...

Then, run `tests.py`, to make sure everything worked!
