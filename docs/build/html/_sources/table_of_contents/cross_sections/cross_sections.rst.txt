==================
cross_sections
==================

Now it's time to calculate a number for the nuclear cross-section
of your reaction. That's proportional to a reaction rate.

We'll have to make a few different types of input files, and run
a code multiple times, once for each bound state of the resultant nucleus.

But then once you have that, you just have to interpret the output!

You'll want to run ``run_transitions.py`` to get these runs started
(well edit the parameters up top first).
