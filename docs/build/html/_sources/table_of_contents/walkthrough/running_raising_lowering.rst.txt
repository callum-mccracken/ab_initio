Raising/Lowering
==============================

The raising_lowering module just has one script, ``shift_j.py``,
which applies the raising and lowering operators to a wavefunction file
generated by NCSD.

Note that if you have zipped ``.egv`` files, you don't have to unzip them,
the code will do that automatically if needed.

1. Make sure you're on ``cedar``, in an interactive session.

   To enter an interactive session, do something like this::

    salloc --account=rrg-navratil --time=0-08:00 --ntasks=1 --mem-per-cpu=4G

2. Open ``raising_lowering/shift_j.py``. You'll see some parameters to adjust::

    eig_path = "/scratch/callum/Li8Li9/ncsd/output/mfdp.egv"
    exe_path = "eigv_Jplus.exe"
    N = 6
    Z = 3
    max_2J = 5

   Edit them as needed.

   In this case, the initial values of 2J and 2T will be 1 and 3.

   So if we want to have eigenvector files with 2J from -3 to 3, say, we could
   change the last line there, to this::

    max_2J = 3

   Or if we wanted -7 to 7::

    max_2J = 7

3. Run the file::

    python shift_j.py

   This will create new, J-shifted ``.egv`` files, in the same location
   as the original files. Just wait for this to finish and you're done!
