So now you know the wavefunctions of your nuclei (you have eigenvector files).

TRDENS, or TRansition DENSity, is the code that calculates matrix elements
of your potential, using the eigenvectors you found.

These matrix elements will be useful later, when we run NCSMC,
but let's save NCSMC for later.

Warning:
    Module under construction, so the documentation is a little
    sketchy / nonexistent in places.
